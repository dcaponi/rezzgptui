By leveraging the power of social media and influencer marketing, Wayward enables creators to monetize their influence, earn commissions from sales, and strengthen their brand partnerships. This innovative platform not only benefits creators but also offers a unique and engaging shopping experience for consumers, bringing together the best of content and commerce in one place.

As Engineering Manager for Wayward you will take full end-to-end ownership of an engineering system playing a pivotal role in shaping their success. The ideal engineering leader is someone with an experimental mindset who is adaptable and can quickly pivot based on user research, is comfortable context switching, can balance strategy with rapid execution, and thrives in ambiguity. You will work in partnership with the data science team to build into a mature SaaS offering complete with business intelligence and artificial intelligence capabilities.
